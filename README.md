# AI Text Generator

## Overview
The AI Text Generator is a Python-based application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 model to generate human-like text based on a user's input. It leverages the power of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to create text responses, making it ideal for use in chatbots, content creation, or any other application requiring dynamic text generation.

This project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `Tkinter` that allows users to interact with the text generation model easily.

## Features
- **Text Generation**: Generates text based on a given prompt.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the model.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Users can input their own prompts to generate unique content.
- **Optimized for Performance**: The application is designed to be fast and responsive, using GPU acceleration for model inference.
